"""
Single-instance guard for Iota.

Telegram allows only ONE long-poll connection per bot token. If two
processes poll at once (a Render re-deploy that leaves the old process
alive, a stray local run, or two scaled instances) Telegram aborts both
with:

    telegram.error.Conflict: Terminated by other getUpdates request

That used to hard-crash the bot and spam the owner with a "crashed on a
command!" DM (with no command → "📛 ?").

This module enforces a distributed lock in MongoDB so that, at any moment,
exactly ONE Iota process drives `run_polling`:

  • On startup each process claims the lock (identified by a random id) and
    writes a heartbeat every few seconds.
  • A process only becomes the primary (and is allowed to poll) if no other
    *healthy* process holds the lock.
  • A secondary process does NOT call getUpdates — it waits in a short retry
    loop, so it can never trigger a Conflict.
  • If the primary dies, its heartbeat goes stale; within `STALE_SECS` the
    next secondary acquires the lock and takes over (self-healing).

The lock auto-expires via the heartbeat, so a killed/crashed primary can
never permanently block a restart.
