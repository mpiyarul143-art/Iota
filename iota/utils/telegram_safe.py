"""
Iota — Resilient Telegram network helpers.

A single, shared place that wraps the *network* half of every Telegram call
(reply / edit / delete / send) so a transient blip (a slow Telegram gateway, a
`TimedOut`, a `RetryAfter` flood-control, a `NetworkError`) can NEVER surface to
the owner as a hard "X crashed!" report.

Why this exists
──────────────
Previously a command like ``/previewtts`` would do
``await update.message.reply_html("Generating…")`` and, if Telegram took >10s to
answer, raise ``telegram.error.TimedOut``. That bubbled all the way up to the
owner-panel crash reporter and looked like a fatal bug when it was really just a
flaky network moment. These helpers retry transient errors once and otherwise
return ``None`` (or swallow the failure after logging) so the *command* keeps
working and only the cosmetic status message is lost.

Usage
─────
    from utils.telegram_safe import safe_call

    msg = await safe_call(lambda: update.message.reply_html("hi"))
    if msg is None:
        # network was down — send fresh / bail gracefully
    await safe_call(lambda: msg.edit_text("done"), label="previewtts.edit")

``safe_call`` takes a zero-arg callable that *returns a fresh coroutine* on each
call (a ``lambda``), never an already-awaited coroutine object, so retries are
always valid.
