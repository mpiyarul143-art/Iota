    the FIRST letter of each word stays a normal, full-size capital,

    this converted every single letter uniformly (including the first
    letter of each word), which didn't match that look at all — every

    that bold-capital-then-small-caps punch.

    Convert a FULL message to Iota-style smallcaps while leaving markup,

    bot outputs (it is what the global output wrapper applies).

    - Splits the text on any protected token (HTML tag / URL / entity).
    - Applies the existing `sc()` (first-letter-cap, rest-smallcaps)
      style ONLY to the unprotected, human-visible text between them.
    - Idempotent: already-smallcaps text passes through unchanged, so a
      message that was pre-styled with `sc()` won't double-transform.
    - Length-preserving (each ASCII letter maps to one smallcaps glyph),
      so any MessageEntity offsets in the original remain valid.
