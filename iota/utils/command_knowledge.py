Iota Bot — Command Knowledge Base (user-facing only)

Single source of truth for "what can Iota do" — used by BOTH:
  - /help's interactive menu (handlers/start.py)
  - the AI chat's self-knowledge (handlers/ai_chat.py's system prompt),
    so users can ask Iota herself "what commands do you have?" or
    "how do I use /rob?" and get an accurate, in-character answer.

🔒 CRITICAL SAFETY RULE — READ BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE:
Only include commands available to REGULAR USERS, GROUP ADMINS, or
GROUP-LEVEL features. NEVER add anything from the owner panel
(handlers/owner_panel.py) — broadcast, /setmodel, /scan, /resetuser,
/giveall, /maintenance, /dm, /addcoins, ban/unban, stars stats, etc.
Those must stay completely invisible to the AI's self-knowledge, or a
user could ask Iota "what owner commands exist?" and she'd have no way
to know NOT to answer, because the information would already be sitting
right there in her own prompt. Keeping owner commands out of this file
entirely means there is nothing for the AI to leak, even by mistake —
this is a stronger guarantee than trying to prompt-instruct the AI not
to repeat something it can already see.

Having ONE file that both /help and the AI draw from also means a
command added here shows up correctttly in both places automatically,
and a command that's accidentally missed is missed in both places
consistently (fail-safe, not fail-open).
